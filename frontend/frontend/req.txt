I. Project Description

Pulse is a crypto-based, mobile-first micro prediction platform that allows users to wager tokens on real-time, short-duration predictions of Bitcoin (BTC) price movements. The goal is to provide an interactive, gamified trading experience with real-time matchmaking, on-chain wallet support, customizable admin controls, and a strong emphasis on referral-driven growth.

The product will support the following features:
	•	Wallet connection and token balance tracking for BeTyche (SPL), SOL, ETH, and RADBRO
	•	Real-time BTC price data from the Pyth Network
	•	Game mechanics based on short-term price prediction (5–60 seconds)
	•	P2P matchmaking engine with automated fallback to treasury-bot if needed
	•	Multi-token staking and win distribution with fee logic
	•	A non-custodial referral and ambassador system with manual payout logic based on net losses
	•	Admin dashboard with robust controls and analytics
	•	Mobile-first Tron-inspired design with neon-themed UI/UX

	Good news:
The game engine is flowing well — bets go through, and win/loss results are showing. The core mechanics are definitely taking shape.

A few things we noticed:

Balance Update Logic
•	Wins and losses are processing, but wallet balances don’t reflect the outcome yet — are balance updates active on-chain, or still pending?

Game Engine Behavior
•	Live BTC price disappears during gameplay — this should remain visible and updating throughout the countdown.
•	Timer sometimes accelerates or goes into negative seconds — might be the reason for the auto-draw issue.
•	It would be great if win/loss resolution could feel a bit quicker — right now there’s a noticeable delay post-game.

Referral System
•	Tested with multiple wallets, and the referrer/referred bonuses didn’t activate — can we confirm if the logic is wired in yet?

Coinbase Wallet Integration
•	Still prompts users to download the desktop extension on mobile — should be a smooth mobile-native experience.
•	At times, Coinbase is the only selectable option, and users can’t pick other wallets (screen recording available if needed).

Fallback Matchmaking Logic
•	Right now it seems to default to P2P — but until we scale users, it should always auto-match with the house bot.
•	Ideally, the switch between P2P and bot fallback should be admin-controlled — turned on/off dynamically as needed.

Mobile Experience + Polish
•	We’ll send over some updated copy and small UX tweaks soon.
•	Keep the focus on mobile-first flow — that’s where 90%+ of our traffic will be.

Quick Notes:
•	Hybrid Price Feed Add-On: We had added $75 to this milestone for hybrid feed support. If you’d rather push it to the next one, just let us know.
•	Ambassador Testing: We’ve got dozens of users ready to test — is there a link we can safely share yet?
•	Pulse Branding: TRON vibes are great — but let’s get Pulse logos and colors visible throughout to solidify identity.

—

All in all, this is a strong foundation. We’re pumped. The core is coming together — just a few finishing touches and we’ll be ready to let people experience it. Let’s keep going strong.
